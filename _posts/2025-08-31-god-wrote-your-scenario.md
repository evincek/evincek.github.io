### Transcript

Anybody here that knows Jesus as savior has a call. You are called by God to do something specific for God. There are no nonentities here tonight, there are no people who should just be drifting through life without a sense of destiny or purpose. If you have become a Christian and committed your life to Jesus Christ, God has a specific individual plan for every one of you. God never makes carbon copies of people. There’s something he has special in this life for every one. And if you’ve never committed your life to Jesus Christ, you can do that here tonight and then that will be equally true of you.

One of the great tragedies in the Christian church is born again Christians who don’t see their own importance, who don’t realize how very special they are in the sight of God.

I’d like to start by reading from 2Timothy 1:8–9.

“Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but share with me in the sufferings for the gospel according to the power of God; who has saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began.”

It’s that 9th verse that I want to focus on tonight which follows on from the end of the previous verse in which the last word is “God.” Paul says there God has saved us and called us with a holy calling. What I want to emphasize tonight is you are saved you are also called. Being called is not an extra thing that’s tacked on to salvation. If you view it that way you may never find your calling. Being called is part of salvation. God has saved us and called us with a holy calling. I trust tonight that I’ll be able to communicate this truth to you in such a way that you will see that your calling is holy. It’s something that sets you apart, it sets boundaries to the things that you can indulge in, it sets limits around your life.

Later I’ll use Paul’s analogy of an athlete. Every Christian should be like an athlete who is set apart to running the fastest or jumping the highest or swimming the fastest or whatever it may be. No athlete can succeed in the world today who does not view his particular area of excellence as something that’s set apart that he devotes himself to, that takes priority over other things that interest other people.

To give you an example from my own background, I’ve never been a tremendous athlete. I played most games that can be played with a ball at one time or another. Not the American version of football, I have to say that, which I don’t understand. I have to admit I just don’t understand it! You laugh at me, see if you can understand cricket! However, I was very keen at the world’s best game which is soccer. That’s right, that’s a real spiritual person on that!

However, you’ve got to understand I’ve lived a long while. I’m talking about 50 years ago. You couldn’t believe that people were alive that long ago but they were! I was very keen in the ballet and I got to know some of the world’s great ballerinas, lady dancers. I still count amongst my friends a lady who I consider to be the greatest ballerina of this century. Those of you that know anything, Margot Fontaine? I knew her from age 16 upwards. As I say, I consider her to be the greatest female dancer of this century. I know why. Because, for her, dancing was something sacred. I mean, it took priority over everything else in her life. If you’re going to succeed in the ballet it’s got to dominate your life. The books you read, the friends you make, the food you eat, the exercise you take. Ballet dancers cannot afford to be swimmers because it develops the wrong muscles. That’s why Margot got to the top. She was dedicated.

That’s in a secular field, the field of entertainment. But I’m saying that every one of you has a calling, has a task in life to which you should give the same kind of priority that a ballet dancer has to give to dancing. If you haven’t realized that you’re probably missing it, you’re messing around, you’re majoring on minors and you’re spending your time and your energy on things that have no real enduring value and missing one of the most precious things in life.

Listen to what Paul says about this calling. It says “he has called us with a holy calling, not according to our works.” Understand? It doesn’t depend on our own ability or our level of education or our social status. If you are seeking a job in the world those are the kind of things that people would quiz you about. How far did you go in school? Do you have any degrees? Have you had any special training? When it comes to your calling in God it’s not based on those factors, it’s not according to our works. You do not have to sit there and say, “I was a high school dropout, I never really made it anywhere. I can’t even hold a job as a janitor.” That is no longer relevant, you see. And if you’re measuring yourself that way you’re not measuring yourself God’s way.

“Not according to our works.” Listen, it gets more and more exciting the further we go. “But according to his own purpose.” Do you realize that God has a purpose for every one of you here tonight? A special, distinctive purpose. “And grace.” Grace is one of the key concepts of the New Testament which you could preach on for a week but let me just say certain things about grace. Grace cannot be earned, okay? Anything we can earn is not grace. There’s lots of things we can earn but they are not grace. Paul says in Romans if it’s of works then it is not of grace. Bear this in mind, grace begins where your ability ends. All right? You are not operating in the grace of God when you’re operating in your own ability. So, if you’re looking at your own ability and saying, “I can’t go further than this because this is all the ability I have,” you are actually denying the grace of God. Paul says God has saved us and called us with a holy calling which does not depend on our works, our ability, but it’s according to his purpose and his purpose is the product of his grace.

You no longer have to sit back and say, “Well, there are things I can’t do.” Or, “I don’t have the right level of education.” Or, “I don’t have the right kind of personality.” Where all that ends is where God’s grace begins, you understand?

Now, it gets even more exciting. “His purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus, before time began.” Isn’t that staggering? Before the world was ever created in eternity the Bible says God foreknew us, he knew us in advance. On the basis of his foreknowledge he chose us. And having chosen us he predestined us. That means he settled in advance the destiny of our lives. Then in time he called us. You see? But the calling is the product of God’s foreknowledge and predestination and choice.

So, you are not an accident looking for somewhere to happen, see what I’m saying? You’re not just a little foam on the surface of the water that’s going to disappear in a few moments. You are part of an eternal plan that God had before he created anything. I don’t think there are any afterthoughts with God, no emergencies. God is never caught unprepared. Whatever situation or circumstance you are in right now, God knew it all in advance. It’s part of his plan for you to be there but it may not be part of his plan for you to stay there, do you understand? Because, when you get hold of the concept of being called it’s one of the most radical life changing concepts that a person can ever grasp.

I trust that before I finish tonight I will have sowed in many of you seeds of something that is going to make deep, permanent, radical changes in you. That’s what Paul says about our calling. God, when he saves us, he calls us. He doesn’t say, “I’ve saved Jane or Bill. What am I going to do with them now that I’ve got them?” Or, “They sure are a mess! What can I make out of them?” No. When he saves you he already has his plan for you. He saves you in order to get you into his plan. That plan is not an emergency measure, it’s something that he thought out carefully before time ever began.

Now, I want to point out to you the Bible makes it very clear that God’s faithfulness in his dealings with us is related to his calling. In this little book about me somebody quotes me as saying, “If I had only one message to leave to posterity—my family, my friends, whoever it might be—I would say it in three words. God is faithful.” But, lots of people don’t really apprehend God’s faithfulness, they’re not quite sure how faithful God really is. Can they really rely on him? Well, the reason why you’re not sure is because God’s faithfulness is directly linked to his calling. It’s only when you come into your calling that you fully experience God’s faithfulness. I’ll show you just a few statements about that.

First of all, in 1Corinthians 1:9.

“God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.”

Notice his faithfulness is directly related to his calling. He’s faithful to work out what he’s called. But if you don’t know what he’s called you don’t even know whether he’s being faithful or not.

Notice here it says we’re called into fellowship. In the religious life, in the Christian life, there are two kinds of things. There are means and there are ends. That’s a philosophic concept but it’s pretty simple to understand. Ends are things that you do for their own sake. Means are things you only do for the sake of getting to an end. Do you understand? It’s very important that we learn to distinguish between them because my observation of many Christians and many churches is they’re so bogged down in means that they never achieve the ends.

For instance, as I understand it, preaching is not an end, it’s a means. It’s only successful and worthwhile if it achieves the desired end. Just coming to church and singing hymns is really not an end, it’s a means. But if it doesn’t achieve the means then it’s a waste of time. I’m afraid that in many churches 90 percent of the time is just totally wasted because it doesn’t achieve the ends.

There are two ends that are clearly stated in the New Testament. One of them is stated here. It’s fellowship. Sharing together. That is not a means, that is an end of the Christian life. It’s something that we should be headed for. We should not be satisfied if we don’t achieve it. I remember years back I was in a Pentecostal church—it could have been any kind of church but it was a Pentecostal church—preaching on Sunday morning. I preached a good sermon. The pastor said it was a good sermon and he said at the end, “Now, there’s a wonderful atmosphere in the church this morning. Don’t rush off home. Stay and have fellowship. Shake hands with half a dozen people before you go.” I thought to myself, “Dear Lord, is that fellowship?” Shaking hands with half a dozen people? If that’s all we’re aiming at I’m not satisfied.

You see, church buildings serve useful purposes but for the most part they do not achieve fellowship. After all, the very way a church building is set out tells you the moment you get in there you’re going to sit in your seat and you’re going to look in a certain direction. There is a P.A. system and everything that is significant is going to happen from behind this pulpit, podium, whatever you want to call it. All you’re going to see of other people is the back of somebody else’s neck. You see, you really can’t fellowship the back of somebody’s neck. I’m not saying churches are wrong. What I’m saying is that’s not an end, it’s a means to bring us into fellowship. But really, in most cases, fellowship is achieved in different environments, in different situations.

If you’re a member of a home group, there’s where you can really have fellowship. You face one another, you talk to one another, you don’t have to follow a set of religious rules. You see what I’m saying? One of God’s purposes in our lives is fellowship. First of all with whom? With God, that’s right. And then with one another. If we are aimed at that God is faithful. You see what I’m saying? God is faithful to achieve his purposes, not necessarily to fit in with ours.

There’s another beautiful scripture about fellowship in 1John 1:1–3.

“That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, concerning the word of life...”

John is talking about the revelation of Jesus in human flesh and in human history.

“(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and dec...(truncated 29554 characters)...iliar with this. You all watch the Olympic games when they were on television. Not one of those people you watched led a self indulgent life. Okay? Every one of them had to exercise mental discipline, physical discipline, emotional discipline. You know, half an athlete’s success is having the right mental attitude. They spend a lot of time just cultivating their mental attitudes. Paul says they’re doing it just for a gold crown or a gold medal or a silver medal. We are in a race that’s going to give us an eternal prize. How much more ought we to exercise self control?

You know, a lot of people think the Holy Spirit will do it all. But one of the fruits of the Holy Spirit is self control. The Holy Spirit won’t control you beyond the point that you determine to be controlled. There is no substitute for your decision. I won’t ask this, I don’t want to embarrass you. If I ask how many of you ladies here have been on a diet and got off without succeeding, many of you would raise your hands. Some of you have been on several. In fact, your life is a kind of diet hopping experience.

I want to tell you, incidentally, that is not the way to have a trim, healthy body. Okay? Diet is a dirty word. What you need is a lifestyle, not a diet. Do you know why you don’t succeed if you don’t? Shall I tell you why? Because you don’t have a vision of yourself. If you had a vision of what you intended to be you’d make the sacrifices, you’d accept the discipline. But without a vision the Bible says people cast off restraint, they lose the ability to control themselves. Why don’t you have a vision? Because you haven’t let God show you his plan for you.

One of the things that God said to me in l962—this is just an example. I had just returned to Europe from 5 years on a mission field in East Africa. I was on the top of a lonesome cliff in the northwest corner of Denmark. I was worshipping the Lord, there was nothing to interrupt me, just seagulls and wind. The Lord spoke to me. I mean not audibly but absolutely clearly. He rehearsed my spiritual career up to that point, he reminded me of the various things I had done. He said, “Now, you’re the member of a denomination. You’re the principal of a teacher training college and you have a pension scheme!” Then he said, “Are you satisfied or do you want to go further?” That shocked me. Do you know why? Because I didn’t think there was anything further to go. I mean, I am embarrassed but that was my attitude. I was saved, baptized in the Spirit, spoke in tongues and so on and so forth.

Well, one thing I’d learned by that time was don’t give God a hasty answer. I said, “Lord, I need time to think this over. I’ll come back when I’m ready with my answer.” About 3 days later I got back to the same cliff top, got in touch with the Lord and said, “Lord, I’m ready to give you my answer.” Then I said, “Lord, I’m not satisfied.” Only when I said I’m not satisfied did I realize how dissatisfied I really was. I think most Christian ministers are dissatisfied but they try to persuade themselves there’s nothing different, that’s the way it’s got to be, that’s the way it always has been. It’s not like the New Testament but that’s all there is. When I said I’m not satisfied I realized the depth of dissatisfaction within me.

Then I said, “Lord, forgive me.” Even today I blush. I said, “Lord, if there is anything further I want to go further.” If there is anything further, just think of that! I got a very swift, practical answer. He said, “If you want to go further there are two conditions. First of all, all progress in the Christian life is by faith. If you’re not willing to go forward in faith you can’t go forward. Secondly, if you are to fulfill the ministry I have for you, you will need a strong healthy body and you’re putting on too much weight. You better see to that.” Very practical. That was in l962. I had no idea that more than 20 years later we would be having healing services that lasted 6 and 7 hours. If I hadn’t heeded God’s admonition I would have dropped out of the race by now. I’m in my 70th year. I have never been more active than I am now in the Lord’s service. I appreciate that, I hope that clap was for the Lord. But you understand, at that point if God hadn’t shown me the need of self control I would never have made it. I would have probably passed to a better world by now.

But you see, I don’t want to go to the better world with my job undone in this world. I’m ready to go when I’ve done what God has called me to do in this life. But not until. If I can hold out, I’m going to.

One other thought, very briefly but it’s very important for people who are a little further down the road than some of you. Stay within your calling. Some men of God are wonderfully blessed and then they think they can do anything and everything. They start moving out in fields of ministry that God didn’t call them to. Like, there are some men who are called to be evangelists but they’ve never been called to be Bible teachers. When they’re evangelizing they’re undefeatable. When they start to teach the Bible they make such a mess it’s tragic. I can name two persons—I won’t—they’re both with the Lord now.

The fact that you can succeed in your calling is no reason for thinking you can succeed when you get out of it. “As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man out of his place,” the book of Proverbs says. How weak and helpless a little fledgling bird is when it’s out of the nest. I’ll just give you one scripture, 2Corinthians 10:13. We could go into this, I just want to point out these words.

“We however will not boast beyond measure, but within the limits of the sphere which God appointed to us, a sphere which especially includes you.”

Paul is writing to the Corinthians and says, “You are part of my God given sphere of ministry. I can write to you with full confidence knowing that what I’m saying comes from God.” But he says, “If I were to get out of my God given sphere it would be different.” Every man of God has a God given sphere. The wise man is the man who stays within it.

My first wife was a Dane and the Danes are probably the most outspoken nation in Europe. My wife was undoubtedly the most outspoken Dane! Living with her knocked some of the Britishness off me. It was a good experience, it wasn’t always easy at the time. One of the things she used to say was this: “The genius is the one who knows his own limitations.” How true that is.

Somebody else said, “Genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains.” See, a genius is not a person who swims halfway between heaven and earth. Most geniuses in their own field are extremely practical. Just think of those things. Genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains.” Think of the great sculptors like Michelangelo. Think of the hours that he devoted to his sculptures.

And then a genius is the one who knows his own limitations. Stay within your sphere. You’re undefeatable and unsinkable in your sphere.

One final thought, I’m just wondering whether you can hold out. Hebrews 12:1–2. We’re talking in terms of an athletic contest as a picture of you in your calling. Here’s a glorious thought. I’m prompted by the story of a friend of mine who’s been serving the Lord faithfully for many years but his mother was a dedicated praying Christian. At that time my friend was far away from God and when his mother died he hadn’t given his life to the Lord. After that, no doubt largely due to her prayers, he did and became a very dedicated, effective servant of the Lord. One day he was with another brother, a senior mature man of god and they were on some errand for the Lord. He said to this man, “If only my mother could see me now.” The other man said, “What makes you think she can’t?” What I want to say is there’s a lot of people watching us we’re really not conscious of, do you understand? We might think we’re just a little group of a thousand people here tonight but there are uncounted thousands watching us. If you could grasp that it will make a difference to the way you live.

I’ll just read Hebrews 12:1–2.

“Therefore we also since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses...”

I think the writer of Hebrews was picturing a race course and the stands all around and he was thinking of that cloud of witnesses as all the people sitting in the stands and watching the runners on the track.

“...let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us.”

This is the picture again of the athlete. There are two things you have to lay aside. One is sin. I think we see that. But the other is weights. Weights are things which are not sinful but they just don’t help you to run, that’s all. What runner ever goes into a race with a pocket knife in his pocket? Or a billfold. You know? Even the smallest object can make the difference between winning or losing a race. So the writer says get rid of all sin. Not only that but get rid of all sorts of things which are not sinful but they just don’t help you to run. Streamline your life.

You won’t do this unless you’ve got a vision. If God gives you a vision—I pray he may do it here tonight—God gives you a vision, all the things that seem to be sacrifices are no longer really sacrifices.

“Looking unto Jesus the author [or the beginner] and finisher of our faith...”

I don’t think we need to read further tonight. I want you to think about this race course, the grandstand all around packed with people. Saints who’ve gone before, finished their course. Maybe some of you have parents who were Christians who prayed for you. Do you realize maybe that your parents sometimes get a little bit on edge when they see you faltering? You have angels that are watching you, they’re on your side, they want the best, they’re cheering you on but they can’t do the willing that has to come inside of you. Only you can do it.

As I said, through my marriage to my first wife I acquired 9 adopted daughters. My wife has gone on to be in glory but all the daughters are still living, they’re scattered around the world. Two in Australia, some of the family in Canada, several in the United States, some in Britain. In a certain sense, I feel not only do I have to answer to God but I’m going to have to give an account to my first wife for what happened to those daughters. She went on and left me to finish the job. See, there’s a certain sense of responsibility. Believe me, being responsible for 9 daughters is not altogether—to say nothing of well over 30 grandchildren and more than 40 great-grandchildren.

That’s all I really wanted to say tonight but I think you have a decision to make. Some of you really need to make a decision here tonight. I felt the anointing of the Holy Spirit, I think I’ve been able to communicate clearly with you. Some of you have already put your body on the altar, you’ve made a total gift of yourself to God, you know you don’t belong to yourself. You know God has a plan for your life. To some extent he’s begun to unfold it to you. But there are many of you here tonight who’ve never made that total consecration which will open the way for the Holy Spirit to renew your mind so that you can find out God’s will. There are many of you that would love to do that. To a certain extent you’re frustrated. You go to church and you sing the hymns and you want to serve the Lord but your life lacks real thrust and you’re not really sure where you’re headed for. I believe the solution for those of you that are in that kind of situation is to be willing to offer your body to the Lord. Say, “Lord, here I am, have all of me. I put my body on your altar and I thank you that when I offer it to you it’s made holy. It no longer belongs to me. All the sins and the uncleanness that may be in my past are all blotted out.”

You know, it’s tremendous what Paul said to the Corinthian church. Think of this. He said in one place, “You were adulterers, fornicators, homosexuals, effeminate, revilers, drunkards, extortioners, all sorts of things. Prostitutes.” But he said, “Now you’re washed, you’re sanctified.” Then he wrote to the same people later and he said, “I have espoused you as a chaste virgin to one husband, Jesus Christ.” What a change! What brings that about? Putting your body on the altar. The blood of Jesus Christ shed on the altar cleanses us from all sin. No matter how defiled we may have been, maybe just in our inward thoughts. The blood of Jesus changes those who put their bodies on the altar.

Would you like to do that tonight? Sit there and think awhile because you’re going to hand yourself over. You’ll walk out of here not belonging to yourself. But remember, your problems don’t belong to you any longer either.
